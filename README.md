# primes
just messing around with prime numbers  
and testing if I could find a way to  
check if a given value is in a list or  
not in constant time.

This implementation isn't fool proof and  
only works with a set of integers, not any  
other data types, but its a proof of concept.

The implementation relies on the properties  
of prime numbers and the transitive (?)  property  
of multiplication.
